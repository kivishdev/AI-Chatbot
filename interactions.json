It demonstrates the other functions.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Get a name from the user\n  user_name = input(\"Enter your name (or press Enter for a surprise): \")\n\n  # Greet the user\n  greeting = greet(user_name.strip() or \"World\")  # Use \"World\" if the user enters nothing\n  print(greeting)\n\n  # Add two numbers\n  num1 = 5\n  num2 = 10\n  sum_result = add(num1, num2)\n  print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}\")\n\n  # Check if a number is even\n  number_to_check = 7\n  if is_even(number_to_check):\n    print(f\"{number_to_check} is even.\")\n  else:\n    print(f\"{number_to_check} is odd.\")\n\n  # Example of a list and a loop\n  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n  print(\"Here are the numbers in my list:\")\n  for num in my_list:\n    print(num)\n\n  print(\"\\nThat's all folks!\")\n\n# This makes sure the main function only runs when the script is executed directly\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  main()\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations:\n\n* **Clear Explanations (Docstrings):** Every function has a docstring explaining what it does, the arguments it takes, and what it returns.  This makes the code much easier to understand.\n* **Handles Empty Input:**  The `greet` function now handles the case where the user presses Enter without typing a name.  It defaults to \"World\" in that situation using `user_name.strip() or \"World\"`.  `strip()` removes leading/trailing whitespace.\n* **Type Hints (Optional, but Good Practice):**  While I haven't added them *directly* (to keep it super basic), the docstrings *describe* the types of the arguments and return values. This is almost as good as using type hints (e.g., `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:`).\n* **Clear Main Function:** The `main()` function organizes the code and demonstrates how to use the other functions.  It's good practice to have a `main()` function in Python scripts.\n* **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`:** This is *crucial*. It ensures that the `main()` function is only called when you run the script directly (e.g., `python my_script.py`) and not when you import it as a module into another script.\n* **User Input:** The code takes user input for the name, making it interactive.\n* **List Example:** Added a basic example of a list and a `for` loop to illustrate a fundamental data structure and looping construct.\n* **f-strings:**  Uses f-strings (e.g., `f\"Hello, {name}!\"`) for cleaner string formatting.\n* **Comments:** More comments throughout the code to explain what each section does.\n* **Conciseness:** The code is written concisely and efficiently while remaining readable.\n* **Error Handling (Minimal):**  While this example *doesn't* have full error handling (like checking if the user enters a number when you expect one), it's a good starting point.  You could add `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., `ValueError` if `input()` receives something it can't convert to a number).\n\n**How to Run the Code:**\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `my_program.py`).\n2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Open your terminal or command prompt.\n3.  **Navigate:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd Documents/PythonProjects`).\n4.  **Run:** Execute the script using `python my_program.py`.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more complete, well-documented, and user-friendly example for someone just learning Python.  It covers the basics of functions, user input, conditional statements, loops, and basic data structures. It's also designed to be easily understandable and adaptable.\n",
